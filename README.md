# PLARGE dev tools configurations

This repository contains **my default development tools settings**.

## Why this repostory?

I use one virtual machine per customer or project.  
It's a very useful professional solution to isolate and ensure that each project is independent.  
But the disadvantage is that you have to configure the development environment for each new virtual machine.

The purpose of this repository is to **define reusable configurations**.

## My development tools

Here are the development tools I use (sort by alphabetic order):

- [NCrunch](ncrunch-configuration/NCrunch-configuration.md)
- [ReSharper](resharper-configuration/Resharper-configuration.md)
- [Visual Studio](vs-configuration/Visual-Studio-configuration.md)
